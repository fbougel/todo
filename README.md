# Coding interview
The following project is a simple, stupid and completely unoptimised todo app.
Now imagine this app being used by millions of daily users, such as Apple Reminders, Google Tasks or Todoist.
How would you refactor and improve this application to meet the engineering requirements of such large-scale applications?

## Objective
- Your task will be to **document all possible improvements and optimisations**.
- Think as a software engineer who cares about code AND user experience.
- You'll have **30mn** to do so.
- Then present and explain your findings to the recruiting team.

If you want to start the project locally, simply run:
`npm run dev`

But you don't necessarily have to do so, here's how it looks
