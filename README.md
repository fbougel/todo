# Coding interview

The following project is a simple and stupid todo app.
Now imagine this component being part of a larger project, with higher code standards and engineering constraints 

## Objective
Your task will be to *document all possible improvements and optimisations*. You'll have *30mn* to do so. 
Then present your findings to the recruiting team

If you want to start the project locally, simply run:
`npm run dev`

You can also simply look at the code in this Github repo.
